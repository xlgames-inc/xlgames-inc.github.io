<p>This is a continuation of the previous page; a tutorial for using spherical harmonic methods for real time graphics. On this page we start to dig into slightly more complex math concepts -- but I'll try to keep it approachable, while still sticking to the correct concepts and terms.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Integrating the diffuse BRDF</h2>

<p>On the previous page, we reconstructed a value from a panorama map that was compressed as a spherical harmonic. The result is a blurry version of the original panorama.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is much more exciting, though -- what if we could calculate the diffuse reflections at a material should exhibit, if it was placed within that environment?</p>

<p>This is the fundamental goal of "image based" real time lighting methods. The easiest way to think about it is this -- we want to treat every texel of the input texture as a separate light. Each light is a small cone light at an infinite distance. The color texture of texel tells us the color and brightness of the light (and since we're probably using a HDR input texture, we can have a broad range of brightnesses).</p>

<p>Effectively, the input texture represents the "incident" light on an object. We want to calculate the "excident" light -- or the light that reflects off in the direction of the eye. We're making an assumption that the lighting is coming from far away, and the object is small.</p>

<p>Since our input texture has a finite number of texels, we could achieve this with a large linear sum:</p>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/SphericalHarmonics/sum_of_texels.png">
<br>
Where <em>t</em> is a texel in the input texture, <em>I</em> is the color in the input texture, <em>d</em> is the direction defined by the mapping (ie, equirectangular or cubemap), <em>a</em> is the solid angle of the texel, and <em>L()</em> is our (somewhat less than bi-directional) BRDF. In spherical harmonic form, we would have to express this equation as a integral (because the spherical harmonic form is a non-discrete function).</p>

<p>But we can do better than this. It might be tempting to consider the blurred spherical harmonic reconstruction of the environment as close enough -- but, again, we can do better!</p>

<p>Yikes; it's been awhile since my last update!</p>

<p>I wanted to share a little bit of information from a technique I've recently been working on for an unrelated project. The technique uses a series of equations called "spherical harmonics" for extremely efficient high quality diffuse environment illumination.</p>

<p>This is a technique that started to become popular maybe around 15 years ago -- possibly because of its usefulness on low power hardware. It fell out of favour for awhile, I was never entirely clear why. I got some good value from it back then, and I hope to get more good value from the technique now; so perhaps it's time for spherical harmonic's star to come around again?</p>

<p>There's a fair amount of information about spherical harmonics on the internet, but some of can be a little dense. There seems to be lack of information on how to take the first few steps in applying this math to the graphics domain (for example, for diffuse environment lighting). So I'll try to keep this page approachable for graphics programmers, while also linking off to some of the more dense and abstract stuff later on. And I'll focus specifically on how I'm using this math for graphics, how I've used it in the past, and how I'd like that to grow in the future.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">What are spherical harmonics</h2>

<p>The "spherical harmonics" are a series of equations that we'll use to compress lighting information greatly. The easiest way to understand them is to start with something simpler and analogous -- and that is cubic splines.</p>

<p>Splines are a method of describing a curve through space with a finite number of points (or points and tangents). Even though the curve is defined by a finite number of parameters, the result is effectively an infinite number of points. To define the curve, we need equations of the form:</p>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/SphericalHarmonics/basic_spline.png">
<br></p>

<p>Where <strong>t</strong> is the distance along the spline (usually between 0 and 1) and <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> &amp; <strong>z</strong> are cartesian coordinates.
In the case of cubic splines, the functions <strong>f</strong>, <strong>h</strong> and <strong>g</strong> are cubic polynomials. If you've used Bezier splines before, you may be familiar with a way to express these polynomials using a form called a <em>"Bernstein polynomial"</em>.</p>

<p>Work is still continuing on XLE! Over the last few weeks, I've have been very distracted by other priorities. I'm likely to be somewhat busy and distracted during for a few more weeks until things return to a more normal situation.
However, I'm still finding time to work on XLE, and make some improvements and fixes!</p>

<p>Lately, my focus has been on <strong>Vulkan</strong> support (in the <em>experimental</em> branch). Vulkan is looking more and more stable and reliable, and the HLSL -&gt; SPIR-V path is working really well now!
However, there are still some big things I want to improve on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved interface for BoundUniforms, that can allow for precreation of descriptor sets during loading phases</li>
<li>Improved interface for Metal::ConstantBuffer and temporary vertex/index buffers that would rely on a single large circular device buffer</li>
<li>Pre-create graphics pipelines when using <code>SharedStateSet</code> (eg, when rendering <code>RenderCore::Assets::ModelRenderer</code>)

<ul>
<li><em>(this might also involve a better solution for the render state resolver objects used by materials)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix triangle hit-test supported used by the tools (which is complicated by the render pass concept and requires stream output support)</li>
<li>Tessellation support for terrain rendering</li>
<li>Integration of MSAA resolve for Vulkan</li>
</ul>

<p>With these changes, we should start to see much more efficient results with the Vulkan pipeline. Some SceneEngine features won't work immediately, but otherwise we will be getting very good Vulkan results, while also retaining the DirectX compatibility! </p>

  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/metallayerrefactoring">Vulkan prototype - metal layer refactoring</a><br /> <span class="date">May 09, 2016</span></h3>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>XLE has a thin layer over the underlying graphics API called "Metal". This was originally built for DirectX11 and OpenGLES. But over time it became more DirectX-focused. Part of the goal of building in Vulkan support was to provide a basis for refactoring and improving the metal layer.</p>

<p>The goals for this layer are simple:
- compile time polymorphism between underlying graphics APIs
 - not link time or run time. We know the target during compilation of client code
- "leaky" abstraction layer
 - meaning that most client code is independent of the underlying graphics API
 - but the underlying objects are still accessible, so client code can write API-specific code when needed
- very thin, minimal overhead
 - for example, many DeviceContext methods get inlined into client code, meaning that performance is similar to using the underlying API directly</p>

<p>To make this kind of layer work, we need to find abstractions that work well for all target APIs. Usually this means finding abstractions that are great for one API, and pretty good for other APIs. That can be tricky, particularly as APIs are changing and evolving over time.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Descriptor Set concept</h2>

<p>Ideally we want the concept of "descriptor sets" to exist in the metal API somewhere. There are two reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clean up the DeviceContext interface so there are fewer BindXX(...) methods</li>
<li>pre-cook permanent descriptor sets using BoundUniforms (or otherwise), so that they can be reused frame to frame</li>
</ol>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>The Vulkan build is steadily getting more and more functionality. Now the core rendering pipeline in SceneEngine is working -- which means we can have deferred lighting, shadows, IBL, tonemapping, etc. Simple scene should render correctly now. But there are some inefficiencies and issues (see below).</p>

<p>Unfortunately the DirectX11 version isn't working at the moment. This is all in the "experimental" branch.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Declarative render passes</h2>

<p>Tone-mapping now works, and it was a good prototype for the "declarative" render pass model. This allows us to specify render passes and render targets required using a "description" structure. The system will do some caching and correlate request to resources, creating and binding as necessary.</p>

<p>There is some overhead with this design because it involves doing some per-frame hash and lookups as we go along. It's not as efficient as (for example) just pre-creating all of the frame buffer / render pass objects in a configure step. However, this design is maybe a little more flexible and easier to tie into existing scene engine code. In effect, we're building a new layer that is just one step more abstract from the underlying Vulkan objects.</p>

<p>I've pushed some of the "busy-work" (like declaring subpass dependencies) down into the RenderCore::Metal layer. This makes the interface easier to use... But the downside is that my abstraction is not expressive enough for some unusual cases. For example, I came across a cases where we want to bind the "depth &amp; stencil" aspects of a depth texture in one subpass; and in the second subpass only the "stencil" aspect is bound. This apparently needs a dependency... But it's just really inconvenient with this interface.</p>

<p>I've also build a concept called "named resources" into the Metal::DeviceContext. This allows us to get TextureViews for  attachments from the device context. It feels out of place because it's an operation that doesn't involve the hardware, but there doesn't seem to be any better way to handle this case.</p>

<p>Fundamentally we want to define attachments FrameBufferDesc objects, so that we can later refer to them again by binding id. It would be better if some of this functionality was in the RenderCore::Techniques library... But it would be just too much hassle to split it better Techniques and Metal.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's working now in Vulkan. However, I still haven't got to the caching and reuse part. And it also needs to be implemented for DirectX11, also!</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Compute shader work!</h2>

<p>I added in support for the compute pipeline. It actually was pretty easy. I decided to switch some of the tonemapping code from pixel shaders to compute shaders -- because this seems to be more natural in Vulkan. Working with viewports and render targets is much more complex in Vulkan than DirectX11.</p>
