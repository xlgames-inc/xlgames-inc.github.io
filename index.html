  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>XLE now support a few area light types: <em>sphere</em>, <em>tube</em> &amp; <em>rectangle</em> (with <em>disc</em> and maybe some other shapes coming soon). Maybe in a future post I'll go into some details about the implementation (actually, it's quite interesting!). But this post is about something different: this post is about why they are important.</p>

<p>I'm finding that it makes a huge difference. So much so that not only do we want to support area lights -- we also want to outlaw non-area lights. Point light sources are now the enemy!</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">PBR Concept</h2>

<p>The biggest buzzword at the moment is Physically Based Renderering (or PBR, or sometimes Physically Based Shading). But what does that mean, really?
Partially it means sampling values from the real world. But really it's just a container under which we're placing many related concepts.</p>

<p>One of these "sub-concepts" of PBR is the idea that a single material should work in many different lighting environments.</p>

<p>In the past, artists often tweaked the material settings for objects to suit the lighting environment they are in. This is a problem because it means that if the object moves into another lighting environment, the material settings must be tweaked to match.</p>

<p>This happen in both movies and games. In games, it's particularly a problem for games with a day/night cycle. In games where time is changing, the lighting environment is also always changing. Previously this means that extreme lighting settings (sunsets, etc) had to be more subtle than real-life. What we want is materials that look correct in all possible lighting environments.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Specular highlight size</h2>

<p>There's a simple way to think about this. Let's consider the size of a specular highlight.</p>

<p>Here are 5 spheres rendered in Blender with Cook Torrence lighting.

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>So, you've just downloaded XLE, and you're wondering what to do first? Here's a suggestion for the first 10 minutes:</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="toc_0">Startup the level editor</h2>

<p>Select the Level Editor as the startup project:
<br><img src="/assets/media/SolutionExplorerLE.png"></p>

<p>You should use the <strong>Debug/x64</strong> or <strong>Release/x64</strong> configuration. Though XLE works in both 32 bit and 64 bits modes, normal usage for the level editor should be in 64 bits mode.</p>

<p>If you have trouble compiling, see the <a href="https://github.com/xlgames-inc/XLE/wiki/CompilingFirstSteps">Getting Started Compiling page</a>.</p>

<p>Start up this application, and you should see a large 3D window and various other windows about.</p>

<p>For the first minute, the 3D window will appear black. This is because shaders are compiling in the background. They will get flushed to disk on application shutdown, so it only happens the first time.</p>

<p>Select <em>"Window/Resources"</em> to open the resources panel. You should see the directory structure under the "working" folder. Here, you can find <strong>.dae</strong> (Collada) files.</p>

<p>Find a dae file, and drag it into the 3D viewport (or you can drag from Windows Explorer).</p>
