  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>The lighting parser is a set of steps (including geometry rendering and full screen passes) that occur in a similar order and configuration every frame. In some ways it is like a higher level version of a "renderpass" (or frame buffer layout). Each "subpass" in the renderpass is like a step in the lighting parser process for evaluating the frame.</p>

<p>But how do we map the lighting parser steps onto render pass subpasses? Do we want to use one single huge render pass for everything? Or a number of small passes?</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Declarative lighting parser</h2>

<p>Since we're using a "declarative" approach for "frame buffer layouts", we could do the same for the lighting parser. Imagine a LightingParserConfiguration object that takes a few configuration variables (related to the current platform and quality mode, and also scene features) and produces the set of steps that the lighting parser will perform.</p>

<p>We could use the <code>VariantFunctions</code> interface for this, along with some structures to define the "attachment" inputs and outputs for each step. If we have a step (such as tonemapping) we just define the input attachments, output attachments, and temporary buffers required, and add the tone map function.</p>

<p>Then we would just need a small system that could collect all this information, and generate a <code>RenderCore::FrameBufferDesc</code> object from it.</p>

<p>This would allow us to have a very configurable pipeline, because we could just build up the list of steps as we need them, and from there generate everything we need. In effect, we would declare everything that is going to happen in the lighting parser before hand; and then the system would automatically calculate everything that needs to happen when we call Run().</p>

<p>This could also allow us to have a single render pass for the entire lighting parser process. But is that what we really want?</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">How many render passes?</h2>

<p>There are a few things to consider:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compute shader usage</li>
<li>frame-to-frame variations in the render pass</li>
<li>parallization within the lighting parser</li>
</ol>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>I'm making more progress on the <em>Vulkan</em> prototype. Now the SceneEngine compiles, BufferUploads works, and it's now possible to render basic geometry. Many features aren't supported. But the core rendering features (such as binding textures, compiling shaders, pushing geometry through the pipeline) have an early implementation.</p>

<p>So, while a working <em>Vulkan</em> version is now close, I have a much better idea of what major hurdles there would be to get a really streamlined and efficient <em>Vulkan</em> implementation!</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">RenderPasses</h2>

<p>This is going to be the big issue. RenderPasses are a new concept in <em>Vulkan</em> (though with heritage from <em>Apple Metal</em> and <em>OpenGL</em>), and not very compatible with the DirectX way of handling render targets. This is going to require some deep thought!</p>

<p>I haven't researched this thoroughly -- but this is my basic understanding of what might be happening...</p>

<p>RenderPasses seem to be fundamentally designed around PowerVR-style hardware (such as that found in IPhones and some Android hardware). Now, if I understand the situation correctly, this type of hardware doesn't need a traditional depth buffer. Instead it collates triangles as they are submitted, then splits them into buckets for tiles on the screen, and finally decomposes them into scanlines. The scanlines can be sorted using an old algorithm, so that for every pixel we know the front-most scanline.</p>

<p>The key issue here is that that we collate triangle information in the frame buffer, and do not produce a final pixel value until all triangles are finished. This requires the hardware to maintain buffers of triangle scanlines attached to the frame buffer.</p>

<p>The key problem here is this: what happens if we have render targets A and B, both of which are used in the same frame. We render to A, then to B, and then switch back to A and start rendering again?</p>

<p>In a traditional DirectX <code>OMSetRenderTargets</code> environment, this is not a big issue. We might do this (for example) to render a reflection into target B, which appears on geometry in target A. Maybe we cause a bit of a GPU pipeline stall; but it's probably not going to be a major issue.</p>

<p>With the PowerVR-style hardware, however, it's a bigger deal. We want to continue collating triangle information in A throughout the entire frame. We don't want to separate that into 2. It would be better if A and B were actually 2 separate viewports onto the same frame buffer.</p>

<p>In other words, when we switch away from A, we kind of want to know if we will be returning to it. That's what RenderPasses are useful for. We can express to the API that A is not finished yet, and that B just contains temporary data that will eventually be used on A.</p>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>After 1 week of playing around with Vulkan, here are 4 tips I've learned. These are maybe not very obvious (some aren't clearly documented), but I think they're important to know.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">1. Use buffers as staging areas to initialize images</h2>

<p>The crux of this is we need to use a function, <em>vkCmdCopyBufferToImage</em>, to implement staging images with Vulkan. It's almost impossible to do any graphics work with Vulkan without doing this -- but a first glance it might seem a bit counter-intuitive. First a bit of a background.</p>

<p>Vulkan images have a "tiling" property, which can be either "linear" or "optimal." This is property relates to how pixels are arranged in memory within a single mip level.</p>

<p>In linear tiling, texels are arranged in row by row, column by column. So a texel's linear address follows this pattern:</p>

<pre><code>address = (y*rowPitch) + x*bitsPerPixel/8
</code></pre>

<p>When we have images on disk, we usually expect them to have this tiling.</p>

<p>However, this has a big problem. Texels in the same row will be near each other in memory. But texels in the same column will be quite separate in memory.</p>

<p>Given that images can be mapped arbitrarily on the final 2D triangles, we can't control the order in which the GPU will access the texels. So this is big issue for the memory cache.</p>

<p>So all GPUs are able to rearrange the texels into a "swizzled" order that tries to guarantee that nearby texels in 2D (or 3D) image space will be nearby in linear memory. This is called "optimal" tiling in Vulkan.</p>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>So, the Vulkan prototype is progress... But I'm running into many problems working with the drivers and the associated tools. Here's some examples of the problems I'm finding.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">RenderDoc crashing</h2>

<p>RenderDoc is the best tool for debugging Vulkan at the moment... But every time I tried to capture a log, it just crashed! The crash report didn't contain any useful information. All I could do was guess at the problem.</p>

<p>Fortunately, RenderDoc has one really great feature... It's open-source! So, I just downloaded the code and ran from Visual Studio (it compiled first time).</p>

<p>RenderDoc is still very unstable for Vulkan. But now that I have my own compiled version, that's not really a big issue. I can just debug any crashes and make changes as required. All of the other GPU debugging tools I've ever used (PIX, console tools, GPA, nsight, etc) have been unstable, as well. But they were all closed source. So whenever I got an error, my only choices were to either use another debugging, or guess at the problem. With this in mind, (open-source + very unstable) is probably better than (closed-source + mostly stable).</p>

<p>My issue was related to "binding" decorations in SPIR-V. RenderDoc requires that all resources have binding decorations. I found this was also an issue for run-time XLE code. Even though the GLSL compiler is capable of generating SPIR-V code without binding decorations, it seems like all practical uses require them.</p>

<p>My shaders weren't getting "bindings" for any resources, and this was the cause of RenderDoc's crashes!</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">HLSL cross compiler and "bindings"</h2>

<p>Part of the issue is related to the HLSL cross compiler. In some cases, the cross compiler can attach "location" values, but it never attaches "binding" values for textures or constant buffers.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the HLSL cross compiler is also open-source... So I can create a fork with the modifications I need. That seems to be required in this case. I could try to attach the binding information later in the pipeline (eg, by modifying the output GLSL, or by inserting instructions into the SPIR-V bytecode)... But changing and improving the cross compiler seems like the best option.</p>

<p>We ideally also want to specify the "descriptor set" in the GLSL code. Unfortunately, HLSL 5 doesn't have an equivalent concept. That is going to require some more effort.</p>

<div class="post">
  <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/vulkanshaderprototype">HLSL shader prototype with Vulkan</a><br /> <span class="date">April 05, 2016</span></h3>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>As part of the Vulkan prototype, I'm experimenting with compiling HLSL shaders to SPIR-V.</p>

<p>The Vulkan API doesn't have a high level shader language attached. Instead, it works with a new intermediate bytecode format, called SPIR-V. This works with the LLVM compiler system, so in theory we plug in different front ends to allow various high level languages to compile to SPIR-V.</p>

<p>That sounds great for the future... But right now, there doesn't seem to be a great path for generating the SPIR-V bytecode.</p>

<p>All of the XLE shaders are HLSL... So how do we use them with Vulkan? Let's consider the options.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Preprocessor framework</h2>

<p>One option is to convert the shader code to GLSL using a preprocessor framework. HLSL and GLSL are closely related... But they vary significantly in the way the shader interface is declared (eg, shader resources, vertex elements, built in values, etc).</p>

<p>We can get around this by using a system of preprocessor macros and complex #includes. We would end up with native HLSL and GLSL code that does the same thing. The core shader code that does the math and lighting (etc) should be fairly compatible between languages... It's just the interface that is an issue.</p>

<p>However this kind of approach it's a bit awkward, and difficult maintain in the long term. And it might mean dropping support for some of the more unusual D3D features I'm using (such as for dynamic linking).</p>

<p>Also, it looks like GLSL might not be around a very long time. It could possibly go the way of OpenGL in the medium term. So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot of time into GLSL, just to have to be replaced with something else later.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Cross compile</h2>

<p>Another option is to try to convert the HLSL output to SPIR-V by way of a cross compiler.</p>
