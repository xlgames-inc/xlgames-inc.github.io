        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>I've included a few Gradle scripts in the XLE distribution. This is mostly just a simple set of tools I use for my own testing. But you may find it useful for your own needs.</p>

<p>Of course this system isn't designed to be 100% robust and fool proof. Actually, it's just a few simple scripts. But it is scalable and flexible.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Gradle</h2>

<p>At heart, an <strong>"asset path"</strong> is some system that can identify changed assets, recognize processing working that needs to be performed with those assets, and schedule that work.</p>

<p>For example, we might have an asset for a sky background texture. Various processing tools need to pre-filter this texture so it can be used for image based lighting. Whenever the texture changes (or when the processing tools change) we want to execute the processing steps and produce intermediate assets.</p>

<p>XLE does some processing at runtime. But that is only practical for short processing steps. Expensive processing steps need some other solution.</p>

<p>So we need some build system to manage assets and dependences. Are requirements are similar to build systems we use for code. But most code-oriented build systems don't work well for assets.</p>

<p>I picked <em>Gradle</em> because of it's procedural nature. It allows us to specify input assets -- but also to give instructions to the build path on how to handle that object. For example, we need to tell the build path if a texture is a sky texture, a normals texture, or some other type... That kind of thing just falls out of <em>Gradle</em> very easily.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Executing Gradle</h2>

<p>First, you need to install Gradle, from: <a href="http://gradle.org/gradle-download/">http://gradle.org/gradle-download/</a></p>

<p>In Tools/AssetPath, we have the "settings.gradle" root project file. Also, this folder contains some "groovy" source files that contain gradle task type implementations. So, there is a task type for processing sky textures -- which basically just involves executing a number of command line operations.</p>

        <h3 class="title"><a href="/posts/transmittedspecular">Transmitted specular</a><br/> <span class="date">January 25, 2016</span></h3>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>I've modified the lighting equations to allow for transmitted (as well as reflected) specular for dynamic lightings. Transmitted specular means the light is on the opposite side of the object, but light is coming through the object towards the viewer.</p>

<p>This is important for thin materials (such as leaves)</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">No transmitted specular:</h3>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/TransSpec/LeavesNoTransSpec.png"></p>

<h3 id="toc_1">With transmitted specular:</h3>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/TransSpec/LeavesTransSpec.png"></p>

<p>Here the amount of transmission is maybe slightly too high -- but it shows the effect well.
This works particularly well with shadowed directional lights and geometry using order independent transparency. The above screenshot is exactly that situation. The tree leaves are rendered with stochastic transparency (which works particularly well for this model). So we get a nice halo effect around the edges of the tree.</p>

<p>And, if you look closely, you can see that the tree shadowing is blocking the transmitted specular, giving a volumetric look.</p>

<p>This model is built in a way to create a lot of noise in the normals. As you can see here:
<br><img src="/assets/media/TransSpec/LeavesNormals.png"></p>

<p>Normals point in every direction, and there is a lot of local variation.</p>

        <div class="summary">
<p>Here is a node diagram for the specular transmission function (BTDF) from Walter, et al, from <em>"Microfacet Models for Refraction through Rough Surfaces."</em>
Also known as the "GGX" model (or Trowbridge-Reitz).</p>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/MaterialTool/WalterGGXTransmission.png"></p>

<p>You can see how the node graph comes in handy for debugging a shader function like this. It's useful to visualize each term and see it's effects.
For example, the "D" term of the BTDF is a node on the diagram. And we can visualize the effects of that term independent of everything else.</p>

<p>In this case, the diagram saves a HLSL function, and that function is called by text-based HLSL code. This will become part of some new functionality for specular transmission through thin surfaces.</p>

<p>I'll pop this in a new "experimental" branch.</p>

<p>See the post from yesterday, <a href="materialtool">Material and Node Diagram Tool</a>, for more information.</p>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>The master branch has just been updated! It now includes a major new tool, called the <em>MaterialTool</em>. This is a dedicated app for building materials and applying them to objects, and includes some cool new features...</p>

<p>In XLE, most material information can be authored in standard graphics packages (like 3DS Max, Maya, Substance Painter, etc). In particular, the most critical material values (<strong>color</strong>, <strong>roughness</strong>, <strong>specular</strong> &amp; <strong>metal</strong>) can come directly from standard packages.</p>

<p>But in cases we want to add custom information to models, or even develop custom shaders for complex materials. This is were the <em>MaterialTool</em> comes in. There is some functionality in common with the <em>ModelViewer</em> and <em>LevelEditor</em> tools -- but the <em>MaterialTool</em> provides a convenient focused tool for this kind of work.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="toc_0">Basic functionality</h2>

<p><br><img src="/assets/media/MaterialTool/BasicWindow.png"></p>

<p>Our core functionality allows us to preview a model (much like the <em>ModelViewer</em>, with various rendering modes), click on materials and then change their properties (such as opacity, translucency modes, and various shader flags).</p>

<p>This works within the Sony ATF framework, and so we have all of the handy features from the <em>LevelEditor</em>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>detachable, arrangeable windows</li>
<li>
<em>IronPython</em> scripting and cvar access</li>
<li>interface skinning, keyboard rebinding, etc...</li>
<li>and, of course, it's all very extensible C# code, convenient for adding custom features</li>
</ul>

        <div class="summary ellipsis">
<p>For many modern engines, the shear quantity of different configuration options for shaders can start to be a major burden. Many compile-time options can end up increasing the number of compiled shaders exponentially. It can get to the point where the shaders data image can make up a large segment of download time, and compile time can be a major hassle during development.</p>

<p>For example, a pixel shader for forward lit scene elements will often need to be specialized to suit the number and types of lights nearby. If we have a few different types of lights, the number of combinations can become very quickly unmanageable.</p>

<p>But we really need a lot of compile time options! They are very useful.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Dynamic linking methods in D3D</h2>

<p>What we really need is a way to do dynamic linking of shaders -- so that we can construct the particular shader we need at runtime.</p>

<p>D3D provides a few different methods for dynamic shader linking.
The one simple method involves "classes" and "interfaces."</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Classes and interfaces</h2>

<p>In the shader code, we can define an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface ILightResolver
{
    float3 Resolve(
        GBufferValues sample,
        LightSampleExtra sampleExtra,
        LightDesc light,
        float3 worldPosition,
        float3 directionToEye,
        LightScreenDest screenDest);
};
</code></pre>
